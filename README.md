# Distance_Matrix_Routing

Worked independently and developed a website for delivery drivers and made it ease to reach multiple destinations in minimal time.

Used TomTom map SDK to get the real-time traffic updates on roads to suggest the best route.

The default route was calculated for the cars and can be changed for other modes of transport as per the convenience.
